/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual
 * Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running
 * concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in
 * preference to threads with lower priority.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to declare a
 * class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This subclass should override
 * the <code>run</code> method of class <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the
 * subclass can then be allocated and started. For example, a thread that
 * computes primes larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
 * <p>
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
 *     p.start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that implements the
 * <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then implements the
 * <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can then be allocated,
 * passed as an argument when creating <code>Thread</code>, and started. The
 * same example in this other style looks like the following:
 * <p>
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
