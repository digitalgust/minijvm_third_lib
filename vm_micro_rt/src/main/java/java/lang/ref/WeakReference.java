 * Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain
 * point in time that an object is weakly reachable.  At that
 * time it will atomically clear all the weak references to
 * that object and all weak references to any other weakly-
 * reachable objects from which that object is reachable
 * through a chain of strong and weak references.

 * Implementation note: It is generally recommended that
 * you don't subclass the WeakReference class.  The garbage
 * collector treats weak references specially, and the
 * subclasses of class WeakReference might not be handled
