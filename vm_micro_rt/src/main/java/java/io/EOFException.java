 * Signals that an end of file or end of stream has been reached

 * generally expect a binary file in a specific format, and for which
 * an end of stream is an unusual condition. Most other input streams
 * return a special value on end of stream.
 * <p>
 * Note that some input operations react to end-of-file by returning
 * a distinguished value (such as <code>-1</code>) rather than by
 * throwing an exception.
