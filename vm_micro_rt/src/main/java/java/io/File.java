/**
 * An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
 *
 * <p>
 * User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent <em>pathname
 * strings</em> to name files and directories. This class presents an abstract,
 * system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An
 * <em>abstract pathname</em> has two components:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> An optional system-dependent <em>prefix</em> string,<br>
 * such as a disk-drive specifier, <code>"/"</code> for the UNIX root directory,
 * or <code>"\\"</code> for a Win32 UNC pathname, and
 * <li> A sequence of zero or more string <em>names</em>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Each name in an abstract pathname except for the last denotes a directory;
 * the last name may denote either a directory or a file. The <em>empty</em>
 * abstract pathname has no prefix and an empty name sequence.
 *
 * <p>
 * The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
 * inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a
 * pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of the
 * default <em>separator character</em>. The default name-separator character is
 * defined by the system property <code>file.separator</code>, and is made
 * available in the public static fields <code>{@link
 * #separator}</code> and <code>{@link #separatorChar}</code> of this class.
 * When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
 * within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
 * other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.
 *
 * <p>
 * A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either
 * <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em>. An absolute pathname is complete in
 * that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
 * denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
 * information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the
 * <code>java.io</code> package always resolve relative pathnames against the
 * current user directory. This directory is named by the system property
 * <code>user.dir</code>, and is typically the directory in which the Java
 * virtual machine was invoked.
 *
 * <p>
 * The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms, and
 * drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Win32 platforms, as
 * follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always
 * <code>"/"</code>. Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname
 * denoting the root directory has the prefix <code>"/"</code> and an empty name
 * sequence.
 *
 * <li> For Win32 platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
 * specifier consists of the drive letter followed by <code>":"</code> and
 * possibly followed by <code>"\"</code> if the pathname is absolute. The prefix
 * of a UNC pathname is <code>"\\"</code>; the hostname and the share name are
 * the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that does not
 * specify a drive has no prefix.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of the <code>File</code> class are immutable; that is, once
 * created, the abstract pathname represented by a <code>File</code> object will
 * never change.
