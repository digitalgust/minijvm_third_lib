/**
 * This interface defines the capabilities that a stream connection
 * must have.
 * <p>
 * In a typical implementation of this interface (for instance
 * in MIDP 2.0), all <code>StreamConnections</code> have one 
 * underlying <code>InputStream</code> and one <code>OutputStream</code>.
 * Opening a <code>DataInputStream</code> counts as opening an
 * <code>InputStream</code> and opening a <code>DataOutputStream</code>
 * counts as opening an <code>OutputStream</code>.  Trying to open
 * another <code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code>
 * causes an <code>IOException</code>.  Trying to open the
 * <code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code> after
 * they have been closed causes an <code>IOException</code>.
 * <p>
 * The methods of <code>StreamConnection</code> are not 
 * synchronized.  The only stream method that can be called safely
 * in another thread is <code>close</code>.
