Espresso java compiler . forked from : http://types.bu.edu/Espresso/JavaEspresso.html


**Java espresso** is a Java 1.0
compliant compiler being developed at Boston University. The project started
last semester under the coordination of Prof. A. J. Kfoury. The objectives
of this implementation were to understand the issues involved in the development
of a modern object-oriented compiler for a real language, to study the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its runtime system and to discover places
where some of the technology developed by [The
Church Project](http://types.bu.edu/Home.html) could be applied.

 Two graduate students were
responsible for the implementation: Santiago M. Pericas (PhD) and Karl
Doerig (MA). Two other students were also involved in the project: Gabriel
Nasser and Jisook Youn. The first non-trivial programs were compiled after
three months of very hard work. The sources for version 0.4 (that includes
support for exceptions) can be downloaded 
[here](http://types.bu.edu/Espresso/espresso.tar.gz).
